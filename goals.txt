Make a separate "demo_game(.cpp|.h)", where there will be a simple gathering/training skills textgame.








1. Idea: Add 2 different multipliers:
  1. score_multiplier( this is the multiplier that works currently )
  2. success_level_multiplier( this will be multiplied times the success level, that is the value after rounding )

hmm, now that I think of it - maybe this would be too much unnecessary complexity?


in
	d16:cpp:calc_d16_score
currently, a multiply of 0 will clearly ensure the success is always 0, but maybe it should default to 1? or, if multiply is less than 1, then it is calculated normally, but success cannot be raised higher than 1?
