Make a separate "demo_game(.cpp|.h)", where there will be a simple gathering/training skills textgame.








1. Idea: Add 2 different multipliers:
  1. score_multiplier( this is the multiplier that works currently )
  2. success_level_multiplier( this will be multiplied times the success level, that is the value after rounding )

hmm, now that I think of it - maybe this would be too much unnecessary complexity?
